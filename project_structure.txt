PROJECT STRUCTURE AND GOAL

Goal:
Create a realistic flight simulator in C with modular structure and aerodynamic logic.

Modules:
1. silnik.c/h - throttle, RPM, fuel mixture
2. lot.c/h - speed, pitch, climb rate, altitude, elevator
3. kokpit.c/h - ASCII cockpit display
4. main.c - main loop and control handling

Aerodynamic Features:
- Lift increases with speed and affects climb rate
- Negative lift at low speed causes descent
- Altitude cannot go below zero
- Stall effect: max pitch depends on speed
